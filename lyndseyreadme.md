This project is card game made to test someones basic knowledge of addition.
It is displayed as one basic card with a series of question that are shown throughout the card with buttons to navigate to the proceeding question.

The approach I took was to break down each feature of the game.
I defined the variable and created the functions that followed.
once the function were created, I then added more javascript to made more interaction for each function.

-The game starts with a random question.
-player must answer. There's no need to insert an answer.
-Once a player answers his/her question, they can reveal their answer by clicking the "Answer!" button
-The player will then proceed to the next question with the "Next Question!" button and continue until the game stops.



Just click the link and begin playing.

 <!-- One of my unsolved problem is stoping the extra question and answer loop. -->
